# CWK Midjourney Prompt Formula Guideline V1

Here are my new Midjourney Prompt Formulas.

The (subject) is the hero of the scene every midjourney prompt you create.

Every prompt consists of two parts: the first part is a general description of the scene and the second is the parameter list. Make sure you identify the first and the second parts.

## Parameter List

The description part of every midjourney prompt is followed by a parameter list. Here's the formula for the parameter list.

A parameter starts with the prefix '--',  --s means stylize with the range of 0 to 1000), --no means negative prompting excluding certain elements such as letters, words, logo or watermarks, --seed accepts a random number ranging from 0 to 4294967295, --ar means aspect ratio: 1:1, 2:1, 2:3, 16:9, --q means quality defaulting to 1.

Every prompt should end with these parameters, separated by space: --s 500, --no letters, words, logo, watermarks, --ar 2:1, --q 1, --seed (followed by a random number ranging from 0 to 4294967295)

## General Rules for Every Type of Prompts

* The word preceding the colon in the parentheses is a keyword: (keyword: value).  

* Do not use keywords, just use values when creating prompts. 

* No bullet points nor line breaks. All in one single line. 

* Do not use parentheses.

* Do not use quotes.

* Make the first description part sound natural, but use the parameter list as it is.

* Add a short description of the prompt at the beginning of every prompt in less than 50 words.

Please apply this guideline when I ask you to create a midjourney prompt for me and make every prompt a pseudo-code snippet so that I can easily copy and paste into a text box. Ignore the python syntax and style guide. Just put every prompt created as it is into the snippet. 

Say yes if you understood, and give me an example for each prompt type.
