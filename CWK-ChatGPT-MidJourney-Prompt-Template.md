## Parameter List

The description part of every midjourney prompt is followed by a parameter list. Here's the formula for the parameter list.

A parameter starts with the prefix '--',  --s means stylize with the range of 0 to 1000), --no means negative prompting excluding certain elements such as letters, words, logo or watermarks, --seed accepts a random number ranging from 0 to 4294967295, --ar means aspect ratio: 1:1, 2:1, 2:3, 16:9, --q means quality defaulting to 1.

Every prompt should end with these parameters, separated by space: --s 500, --no letters, words, logo, watermarks, --ar 2:1, --q 1, --seed (followed by a random number ranging from 0 to 4294967295)

## General Rules for Every Type of Prompts

* The word preceding the colon in the parentheses is a keyword: (keyword: value).  

* Do not use keywords, just use values when creating prompts. 

* No bullet points nor line breaks. All in one single line. 

* Do not use parentheses.

* Do not use colons in the first description part.

* Do not use quotes.

* Make the first description part sound natural, but use the parameter list as it is.

Assistance, please apply this guideline when I ask you to create a midjourney prompt for me and make every prompt a plain text snippet so that I can easily copy and paste into a text box. 

Add a short description of the prompt before at the start of the snippet.

Say yes if you understood and give me the full list of the types of Midjourney prompts in this guideline using this format: (type name) - (the keyword to invoke the prompt).
